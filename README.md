# NgrxWorkshop

This clean angular cli repository is going to be our starting point for our angular NGRX workshop.
For each new step or angular ngrx feature to discuss, we are going to to have a branch:

1 - ngrx packages installation, initial set up
2 - creating first ngrx simple flow [store, state, actions, reducers, selects]
3 - creating a secong flow with effects [store, state actions, recducers, effects, selects]
4 - small walk through of ngrx dev tools
5 - example of unit testing our store

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
